### Development Containers [devcontainers](https://containers.dev/)
Life will become easier if you are using an IDE that supports devcontainers and you have [Docker](https://docker.com) running.  
This can be remote like [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) or local like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)(VSC) or any IDE that support devcontainers.

You can 'Reopen in Container' when you open this repository in for example VSC. Your IDE will create a docker image and start the container, be patient this can take a while if you do this the first time.

Once your container is running you will see your workspace(/app/src) on the left. We have hidden the project files(tsconfig.json, ...) but if you need them use your terminal or update the workspaceFolder in ```.devcontainer/devcontainer.json``` and rebuild(press cmd/ctrl+shift+p or F1 and select 'Dev Containers: Rebuild Container')

### Configuration
All direct relevant configurations are located in ```package.json```

```json
  "nde": {
    "proxy": {
      "target": "YOUR_PRIMO_NDE_URL"
    },
    "build": {
      "institution": "YOUR_INSTITUTION_CODE",
      "view": "YOUR_VIEW_CODE"
    }
  }
```

### List commands
```bash
  npm run
```

### Starting the PROXY
```bash
  npm run start:proxy
```
Accessing Primo NDE through the proxy
```url
  http://localhost:4201/nde/home?vid=32KUL_KUL:KULeuven_NDE&lang=en
```

### Creating a component
Components must ge created in the ```/app/src``` directory. If you did not mess with your configuration then this is the default directory of your terminal.   
For example let us create a dot component in a libis sub directory.
```bash
  ng generate component libis/dot --module custom1-module
```
Component should have been created. Open the .ts file and update the selector to 'lbs-dot' this is the element tag that will be used in Primo NDE.
```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'lbs-dot',
  templateUrl: './dot.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./dot.component.scss']
})
```

Import and register the location the component needs to be injected.
```typescript
import {DotComponent} from '../libis/dot/dot.component'

export const selectorComponentMap = new Map<string, any>([  
  ['nde-logo-after', DotComponent]
]);
```

### Creating a package
```bash
  npm run postbuild
```
Your package will be located in ```dist/YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME.zip```
